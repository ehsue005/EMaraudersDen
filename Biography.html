              <img src="Portrait.jpg" height="300px" width="auto" style="float: left" alt="A potait photograph of Emily Hsueh"> 
              <p style="margin-left: 320px"> Emily Hsueh, known online as EMarauder, is a student at the University of Ottawa majoring in digital journalism. She previously spent a year studying <a href="https://laurentian.ca/program/motion-picture-arts">motion picture arts at Laurentian University</a> in Sudbury, Ontario, but moved back to her hometown after she decided the film industry was not for her. She is still unsure of her ideal career but is partial to the idea of becoming a gaming and/or eSports journalist, or doing other writing for video games. Videojournalism is also an interest.</p>

              <p style="margin-right: 320px">Emily spends most of her time both playing and watching video games, particularly the popular game <em>League of Legends</em>. Music is also important to her; she has been playing piano her whole life and currently plays bass for the <a href="https://www.ottawapopsorchestra.ca/">Ottawa Pops Orchestra</a>, and previously for the Ottawa Youth Orchestra. She also has a passion for art, both on traditional and more recently, digital media.</p>
